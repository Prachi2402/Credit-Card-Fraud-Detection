# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Credit card fraud is a major concern for banks and financial institutions. Fraudsters use various techniques to steal credit card information and make unauthorized transactions. In this project, we will explore a dataset containing credit card transactions and build models to predict fraudulent transactions.

# About Dataset

We will use the Kaggle dataset which contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders. The dataset consists of 284,807 transactions, out of which 492 are fraudulent. The data contains only numerical input variables which are a result of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformations due to confidentiality issues. The features include 'Time', 'Amount', and 'V1' through 'V28', as well as the 'Class' variable, which is the target variable indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).
